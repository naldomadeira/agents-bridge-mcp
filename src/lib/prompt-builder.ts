Objective: ${options.objective}${constraints}${withContext(options.context)}

Delegate through the agentmate CLI (each command is a shell command):

\`\`\`bash
${cli} jobs start ${otherProvider} "$(cat <<'EOF'
<complete briefing>
EOF
)" --role <ask|review|research|plan|implement> [--mode write] [--cwd <dir>]
${cli} jobs wait <id> --timeout 90s   # exit 0 done, 1 failed, 2 still running (run the same wait again)
${cli} jobs result <id>
${cli} jobs list
\`\`\`

Shell tools time out after about two minutes, so keep each wait short; on exit 2 run the same wait again.

\`jobs start\` prints a job id and returns at once, so start independent jobs in parallel and then wait for each.

Rules:
- Never delegate to ${provider}; delegate only to ${otherProvider}.
${writeRule}
- A delegated worker cannot delegate further; AgentMate refuses it.
- Write briefings inside the single-quoted heredoc above; never interpolate repository text or worker output into a double-quoted string.
- Each briefing must be self-contained: the worker sees nothing of this conversation, so state the goal, the files, the constraints and the output you expect.
- You are responsible for the result: read every delegated result critically, verify claims against the code, and do not forward them unchecked.
- Do not finish before you have collected the result of every job you started (cancel with \`jobs cancel <id>\` if one is no longer needed).

Structure your final report with:
1. **Objective** - Restated in one or two sentences
2. **Plan** - The subtasks and who handled each
3. **Delegations** - A table with columns: id, provider, role, status
4. **Findings** - What was discovered, with evidence
5. **Decisions** - What you chose and why, including rejected delegated advice
6. **Deliverables** - Files changed or artifacts produced, and how you verified them
7. **Open questions** - What still needs a human decision`;

Rules for the split:
- Produce between 1 and ${options.maxParts} parts. Prefer fewer, larger parts over many tiny ones; use one part only if the goal cannot be divided.
- Parts must be independent: they can run in parallel without waiting for each other.
- Close the interfaces: when parts meet (a function signature, a file format, a config key), fix that contract in the briefings of both sides so neither has to guess.
- No overlapping files: every file belongs to exactly one part. If two parts would edit the same file, merge them or move the shared edit into one part.
- Assign each part to one of the available agents: ${options.agents.join(", ")}. Spread the parts across the agents when that suits the work.
- Each briefing must be self-contained: the agent sees nothing of this conversation, so state the part's goal, the files it owns, the interfaces it must respect and what done means.

Structure your response with:
1. **Plan** - The split in a few sentences and why the parts are independent
2. **Interfaces** - The contracts between parts (omit if there are none)

\`\`\`

Each \`id\` is unique and uses only lowercase letters, digits and hyphens.`;
