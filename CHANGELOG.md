# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.5.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- Agent adapters in `src/agents/` (Codex and Claude behind one `AgentAdapter` interface and a registry); the runtime no longer branches on agent names.
- Job events: every job writes an append-only `events.jsonl` with `important`, `status` and `fyi` levels (started, message, file, command, finished, error). Codex events stream while the job runs; Claude, which has no stream, records one message at the end.
- MCP tool `mate_events` and CLI `jobs events <id> [--since <iso>] [--level <a,b>] [--follow]`.
- `mate_observe` and `jobs observe` accept `raw` / `--raw` to include the stdout/stderr tails, and `levels` / `--level` to widen the events.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` describing the runtime, adapters, jobs and events.
- `crossreview` role: a workflow job where `provider` implements (write mode) and the other agent reviews the uncommitted diff (read-only), as child jobs of one workflow, looping up to `maxRounds` (1 to 5, default 2). The reviewer must end with `Verdict: approve` or `Verdict: request-changes`: approve finishes, request-changes continues the implementer's session with the findings, no clear verdict stops with a `## Needs human` section, and a failed child fails the workflow. The report has the rounds table, the final review and the changes; `job.workflow` records the rounds. Only a top-level session can start it.
- MCP tool `mate_crossreview(provider, task, acceptance?, maxRounds?, cwd?, model?, timeoutMinutes?, waitSeconds?)`, CLI `jobs start <provider> "<task>" --role crossreview [--max-rounds N]`, the `crossreview` skill (`/mate:crossreview`, `$mate:crossreview`) and the `crossreview` command templates (bare `/crossreview`, `/prompts:crossreview`).

### Changed

- The review prompt now requires its last line to be exactly `Verdict: approve` or `Verdict: request-changes`, so workflows can parse it.
- `observe` shows filtered events (`important` and `status`, last 30) instead of the raw stdout/stderr tails; pass `raw` for the tails.
- `cancel` kills the whole worker process group, so grandchildren do not outlive a canceled job.
- `AGENTMATE_HOME=""` is treated as unset.
- A recycled PID is no longer mistaken for a live worker (the process command line must match the job).

### Deprecated

- The synchronous servers (`serve codex`, `serve claude`) and `setup` print a deprecation warning to stderr and will be removed in 0.6.0. Install the plugin (`mate@agentmate`) and use the `mate_*` job tools instead. Behavior is unchanged in 0.5.0.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-03

### Changed / Breaking

- The project is renamed from Agents Bridge to **AgentMate** — *AI agents work better together.* AgentMate connects AI coding agents so they can collaborate, delegate, review, and help each other complete tasks.
- npm package `agents-bridge-mcp` → `agentmate` (`npx -y agentmate doctor`); the legacy synchronous-server bins `abm-claude` / `abm-codex` → `agentmate-claude` / `agentmate-codex`.
- Marketplace `agents-bridge` → `agentmate`, plugin `bridge` → `mate`: the install id is `mate@agentmate` and the commands are `/mate:<skill>` in Claude Code and `$mate:<skill>` in Codex. Agents are `mate:codex-reviewer` and so on.
- MCP server key `agents-bridge` → `agentmate`, tools `bridge_*` → `mate_*`.
- State directory `~/.agents-bridge` → `~/.agentmate` (`AGENTMATE_HOME`); environment variables `AGENTS_BRIDGE_*` and `BRIDGE_*` → `AGENTMATE_*` (`AGENTMATE_SYNC_DEPTH`, `AGENTMATE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `AGENTMATE_MAX_RETRIES`, `AGENTMATE_DEBUG`, `AGENTMATE_CLAUDE_WRITE_TOOLS`, `AGENTMATE_<PROVIDER>_BIN`). Existing jobs are not migrated.
- The repository moves to `naldomadeira/agentmate`.
- Migrating from 0.3.0 or earlier: remove the old plugin (`bridge@agents-bridge`, or `agents-bridge@agents-bridge` from 0.2.0) and the `agents-bridge` marketplace, install `mate@agentmate` and restart the host. `doctor` still detects legacy `agents-bridge-mcp serve` registrations.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-03

### Changed / Breaking

- The plugin is renamed from `agents-bridge` to `bridge`, following the `agy` plugin pattern: the plugin name is the command namespace in both hosts. The marketplace stays `agents-bridge` and the npm package stays `agents-bridge-mcp`. The install id changes from `agents-bridge@agents-bridge` to `bridge@agents-bridge` (`claude plugin install bridge@agents-bridge`, `codex plugin add bridge@agents-bridge`), and the commands change from `/agents-bridge:<skill>` to `/bridge:<skill>` in Claude Code and from `$<skill>` to `$bridge:<skill>` in Codex. The MCP server key stays `agents-bridge`, so `bridge_*` tool names are unchanged.
- Migrating from 0.2.0: remove the old plugin (`claude plugin uninstall agents-bridge@agents-bridge`; in Codex, remove the `agents-bridge@agents-bridge` plugin, see `codex plugin --help` for the exact verb), install `bridge@agents-bridge` and restart the host.
- Update commands are now `claude plugin marketplace update agents-bridge && claude plugin update bridge@agents-bridge` and `codex plugin marketplace upgrade agents-bridge && codex plugin add bridge@agents-bridge`.
- Every skill description now lists trigger phrases (for example `/bridge:ask`, "ask codex", "pergunte ao claude") so the model selects the skill on its own.
- README (English and Portuguese) is restructured: an "Invoke a role" subsection, a "For agents" snippet that points at the raw install guide, an "Upgrade" subsection and a "Use cases" table. The "Slash commands" section lists `/bridge:ask` and `$bridge:ask` as the plugin forms; bare `/ask` and `/prompts:ask` remain optional extras. Both installation guides gain a migration note.
- npm package, plugin manifests and marketplace moved to 0.3.0.

### Added

- Slash-command templates in a new `templates/` directory (shipped in the npm package, not scanned by either host): `templates/claude-commands/` for Claude Code and `templates/codex-prompts/` for Codex, each with `ask`, `review`, `research`, `plan`, `implement`, `teamlead` and `jobs`.
- `install commands <claude|codex|both> [--global|--local]` copies them: bare `/ask`, `/review`, ... to `~/.claude/commands/` (or `./.claude/commands/`) for Claude Code, and `/prompts:ask`, `/prompts:review`, ... to `$CODEX_HOME/prompts/` (default `~/.codex/prompts/`) for Codex. Codex custom prompts are user-level only, so the local scope installs them globally. It asks before overwriting and prints the installed command names.
- The README notes that OpenAI marks Codex custom prompts deprecated in favour of skills, and both installation guides document the optional `install commands` step.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Job roles: `ask`, `review`, `research`, `plan`, `implement` and `teamlead` (plus `custom` for a raw prompt). Each role sends a purpose-built prompt with a defined output format and runs with role-specific permissions.
- MCP tools `bridge_ask` (waits for the answer, up to 120 seconds by default), `bridge_review`, `bridge_research`, `bridge_plan`, `bridge_implement` and `bridge_teamlead`. `bridge_start` accepts `role`, `bridge_list` accepts `parent`, and `bridge_observe` lists the child jobs of a team lead.
- Team lead mode: a worker that decomposes an objective, delegates to the other provider through the CLI, reviews the results and returns a structured report. Jobs record `depth` and `parentJob`.
- CLI: `jobs start --role`, `jobs ask <provider> "<question>" [--wait 120s]`, `jobs list --parent <id>`, and a `children` section in `jobs observe`.
- `doctor` command: checks Node.js, that the `codex` and `claude` CLIs exist and respond to `--version`, the job state directory, stale `running` jobs (it lists their ids) and legacy registrations, and exits `1` when a check fails. It does not check authentication.
- Skills `ask`, `review`, `research`, `plan`, `implement`, `teamlead` and `jobs`, shared by Claude Code and Codex.
- Claude Code agents `codex-reviewer`, `codex-researcher` and `codex-teamlead`.
- Claude research jobs can use `WebSearch` and `WebFetch`.
- `src/lib/version.ts` as the single source of the runtime version.
- This changelog and a rewritten README with a quickstart, a role matrix, a safety model and troubleshooting.

### Changed

- The `codex` and `claude` skills and the `codex-teammate` agent now route to the `bridge_*` job tools instead of the legacy synchronous `mcp__codex__*` and `mcp__claude__*` tools. They fall back to the `npx -y agents-bridge-mcp jobs` CLI when MCP is not loaded.
- The `delegate` skill points to the role skills and documents the delegation depth limit of 2.
- Codex jobs run with `--skip-git-repo-check` and a sandbox that follows the mode: `read-only`, `workspace-write` for `write`, and `danger-full-access` only for a Codex team lead.
- The `.claude/skills/setup` skill presents the plugin install first and is labeled legacy.
- npm package description, keywords and `repository.url` (now `git+https://...`); plugin manifests and marketplaces moved to 0.2.0.
- `implement` (`--role implement`, `bridge_implement`) always runs in write mode; passing `read-only` is rejected.
- Write-mode Claude jobs (`implement`, write `teamlead`) run with `acceptEdits` plus an allowlist for verification commands: the read-only list plus `pnpm`, `npm`, `npx`, `yarn`, `bun`, `make`, `git add` and `git commit`. Extend it with `AGENTS_BRIDGE_CLAUDE_WRITE_TOOLS` (comma-separated Claude permission patterns).
- A Claude team lead's CLI access is limited to `agents-bridge-mcp jobs *`, pinned to the installed version (no `setup` or `install`). The team lead prompt pins the CLI version, writes briefings in a single-quoted heredoc and waits with `--timeout 90s`, repeating on exit code 2.
- Stored job `depth` is 0 for a job started by a session and 1 for a job started by a worker; the documentation and diagrams now use this numbering.
- `jobs start --timeout` must be a positive number of minutes (at most 120) and is validated.
- The skills and README tell Codex callers to pass `waitSeconds: 45` to `bridge_ask`, because Codex limits an MCP tool call to about 60 seconds by default.

### Fixed

- Claude jobs with a tool allowlist passed `--allowedTools` in a form that swallowed the prompt, so every such job failed. The allowlist and the prompt are now passed separately.
- `npx -y agents-bridge-mcp --version` now prints the version.
- `doctor` lists the ids of stale `running` jobs instead of only counting them.

### Security

- Delegation depth limit of 2 (`AGENTS_BRIDGE_DEPTH`): a session starts a team lead, the lead starts children, and children cannot start jobs. The runtime refuses a third level and refuses a team lead started by a worker.
- Jobs remain read-only by default. `implement` always runs in write mode; a team lead writes only when started with `mode: write`.
- Read-only Claude jobs (`ask`, `review`, `plan`, `research`, read-only `teamlead`) run with an allowlist and an explicit deny of `Edit`, `Write` and `NotebookEdit`.
- A Codex team lead runs with `--sandbox danger-full-access` in either mode, because it must spawn worker processes and write job state. In read-only mode the runtime refuses any `write` child job (a read-only parent cannot start write children) and the prompt forbids edits, but the lead itself is not sandboxed. Use `claude` as lead when that matters.
- Files under `~/.agents-bridge` are created owner-only (`0600` for files, `0700` for directories).

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Background job runtime with MCP tools `bridge_start`, `bridge_wait`, `bridge_observe`, `bridge_result`, `bridge_cancel` and `bridge_list`, and the matching `jobs` CLI commands.
- Delegation to `codex` or `claude`, with a `read-only` default mode, `write` mode, timeouts and session continuation (`--continue`).
- Hybrid plugin for Claude Code and Codex with the `delegate` skill and the jobs MCP server.
- Synchronous bridge servers (`serve codex`, `serve claude`), the legacy `setup` command, and the `/codex` and `/claude` shortcuts.
- Bilingual documentation (English and Brazilian Portuguese) and an installation guide.
